Cats have been **stigmatized** and **negatively portrayed** in media. People are most likely to pick dogs due to their enthusiasm and joyful traits, making them notable companionships. Cats may seem cold at first and can be too indepedent but this does not mean they will always ignore and scratch their human companionships. In reality, they are just like us humans and are often misunderstood. In order to understand these felines more, here are reasons why cats *do* have feelings.


## Understanding Cats Emotions

Cats communicate their emotions subtly, which is often misinterpreted as aloofness. While dogs wag their tails in excitement, a cat’s emotional spectrum requires attention to smaller cues like purring, kneading, and body posture. These signals show that cats experience a wide range of feelings, from joy and affection to fear and sadness.

**Purring:** Often associated with contentment, purring can also signify self-soothing or seeking comfort.

**Kneading:** Cats knead as a sign of relaxation and trust, often linked to kittenhood behaviors.

**Body Language:** Flattened ears, an arched back, or a flicking tail can indicate stress, while slow blinking expresses trust and love.

## Scientific Evidence of Cat Emotions

### Neurological Insights
The feline brain shares similarities with the human brain, particularly in the limbic system—the area responsible for emotions. Cats also release oxytocin, the "love hormone," when interacting with their humans, highlighting their capacity for affection and bonding.
### Behavioral Studies
Behavioral observations confirm that cats grieve the loss of a companion and display jealousy if attention is diverted elsewhere. They exhibit signs of stress when their routine changes or their environment becomes unpredictable.
